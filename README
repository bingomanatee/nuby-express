The "Event" branch is devoted to three things:

1) returning nuby-express to a test validtated framework
2) creating a set of self-loading components as opposed to a top-down loading module.
3) erasing the schism between rest and non rest controllers
4) getting rid of callback-style properties
5) putting frameworks, models and resources into the require system.
